Contributing to the Engineering Working Group
================================================

The Consumer Data Standards team, operated by Data61, are committed to undertaking conversations relating to the technical standards in the open. Questions or comments that participants might ask us via email or private message are likely to be questions or comments other participants have as well. Our answers will be of interest to everyone. There are likely to be experiences and lessons everybody working in this ecosystem can learn from. Having these conversations transparently helps us reduce duplication, resolve issues faster and keep everyone up to date with the conversation.

We ask that all contributors to the Consumer Data Standards repositories comply with the GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct.

In addition, it would be appreciated if the following rules are adhered to when commenting or contributing:

* Please provide a single, considered response to each proposal covering all feedback concerning the proposal.
* For transparency, if you work at or are associated with an organisation with an interest in the standards, please indicate this in your response.
* Please ensure you are aware of and compliant with any social media guidelines or internal processes for response set by your organisation before providing feedback.
