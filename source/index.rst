   This is the documentation for engineering artefacts produced as part of the Consumer Data Right

Welcome to the CDR Engineering Documentation!
================================================

| Data61 is supporting the development of API standards to help Australian consumers provide trusted organisations of their choice with access to their data, in safe, customer-friendly ways. Its first focus is the banking sector. The aim? A more innovative, open banking sector with consumers able to make informed choices about their finances: whether that’s using product comparison services, getting personalised budgeting and accounting support or making decisions about the bank that’s best for them.

| The Engineering Working Group will focus on delivering usable software components (Reference implementations) and systems artefacts (sandbox).

| This documentation is intended to be the primary location for documentation produced by the Engineering Working Group. This documentation is generated and published automatically from the `master` branch of the `Engineering Repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/engineering>`_
