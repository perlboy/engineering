Engineering Workshop Round 1
=======================================================

| In order to ensure that the software assets produced as part of the :term:`CDR` project are **useful** to participants in the scheme it is critically important that industry consultation occurs.

| The Engineering Workshop Round 1 focuses on the development and communication of the intended deliverables from the :term:`Engineering Working Group` in order to obtain validation they are **useful** to the scheme participants.

| At this stage the intended software artefacts to be delivered are roughly summarised as follows:

1) Reference Implementations

  a) A framework to effectively generate :term:`Standards API` compliant software artifacts
  b) A :term:`Client Library` generated in Java using this framework
  c) A :term:`Server Stub` generated in Java using this framework

2) A Desktop Based Sandbox which provides a usable and useful simulation of a :term:`Data Holder` environment
