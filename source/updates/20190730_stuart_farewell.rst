Most of the CDR community already are aware that Stuart Low has left Data61 to pursue other interests.

We thank Stu for his passionate contribution to the CDS discussions and particularly for his work developing the related engineering outputs.

The return of Perlboy is already evident and we look forward to his constructive involvement to help make the CDR regime a success!

All the best going forward, Stu!
