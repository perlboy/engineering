Hi all,

The Engineering team are pleased to announce a new release of our testing artefacts, which have been updated to conform to version 1.0.0 of the Data Standards.

The key artefacts of interest in this release are the payload validation tool, available in a `standalone command line tool <https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/java-artefacts/tree/master/client-cli/>`__ and our parameterised test tool, which is executed as a maven goal and can be found in the reference-test suite `reference-test suite <https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/java-artefacts/tree/master/reference-test/>`__.

For a quick overview of how the two tools work, please refer to these two diagrams:
