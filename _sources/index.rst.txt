Welcome
=========

Data61 is supporting the development of API standards to help Australian consumers provide trusted organisations of their choice with access to their data, in safe, customer-friendly ways. Its first focus is the banking sector. The aim? A more innovative, open banking sector with consumers able to make informed choices about their finances: whether that’s using product comparison services, getting personalised budgeting and accounting support or making decisions about the bank that’s best for them.

The Engineering Working Group focuses on demonstrating these API Standards through the delivery of usable software artefacts.
