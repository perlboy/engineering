Hi there,

It's been a little while but I have now published updated documentation for the 0.9.3 artefacts.

In addition I've uploaded and linked the :ref:`workshop-2` material.

With this documentation you should now be able to get up and running with the various components of the CDS Engineering suite including:
    
    * Client Java Library
    * Client Java CLI
    * Conformance Suite
    * Register Simulation
    * Model Holder in Java
    * Model Stubs in Java
    * Code Generation for Swagger & Librariez
    * Product Summarisation

As always, feedback is welcome, just open an issue on GitHub.

Thanks,

Stuart
