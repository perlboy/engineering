As communicated previously we have been working towards an initial set of feedback requests. The first two of these are now published and open for comment (see title links) on the GitHub engineering issues list.

Our intention will be to have these formally submitted as Decision Proposals following an initial feedback period. Our target completion duration for feedback is 14 days but we are open to extensions when "it makes sense".

**Feedback Request #1: Engineering Artefacts**

`Feedback Request #1: Engineering Artefacts <https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/engineering/issues/25>`_

The Engineering working group should develop a Conformance Test Suite, Java Client Library and Server Stubs and a Desktop Sandbox.

The Data Standards Body, specifically the Engineering stream, should develop a set of software artefacts to enable the adoption of the Consumer Data Standards as follows:
1. Conformance: Enable verification that participants are technical compliant
2. Reference Implementations: Development of a Java Client Library and Java Server Stubs
3. Desktop Sandbox: A standalone simulation of the Consumer Data Standards ecosystem to enable new participants to rapidly discover and build minimum viable products demonstrating their business ideas.

**Feedback Request #2: Shared Definition Approach**

`Feedback Request #2: Shared Definition Approach <https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/engineering/issues/26>`_

Developing software artefacts with a compilable model in Java (cds-models) ensures long term sustainability within the Engineering outputs produced by the Data Standards Body.

The Data Standards Body, specifically the Engineering stream, have an ongoing objective to provide software artefacts which enable verification that participants are technical compliant (“Conformance”), enable new participants within the scheme to efficiently build solutions utilising the Standards (“Client Libraries”) while providing examples of how a Data Holder can implement the Standards (“Server Stubs”).

All of these rely on a shared and suitably accurate description of how data is exchanged between participants and this requires the “wrapping up” into a “shared library” capability to ensure consistency of the resultant artefacts.

Finally, the Data Standards Body has an imperative to kickstart the local ecosystem around the emerging Standards and therefore must consider timeline constraints.
