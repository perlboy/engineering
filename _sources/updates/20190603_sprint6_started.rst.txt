It's been a few weeks since I last sent an update so I thought it was prudent but I will keep it short.

Both Sprint 4 and Sprint 5 focused on internal code review with significant tweaks around ensuring the code developed for the artefacts had a high quality baseline. Following the result in Canberra, it is important that we realigned our work with the intended CDR delivery schedule so that we can ensure that the tools delivered are the most useful relative to the expectations of the government for Data Holder's.

**Sprint #6 Delivery** 

With the version **0.9.3** of the Standards on Friday, Engineering has now realigned it's Sprint #6 deliverables as follows:

  1) Synchronise our artefacts to Standards 0.9.3 (particularly Product Reference Data)
  2) Focus on Product Reference Data deliverables including:
  
    a) Conformant Holder Sample for PRD: :ref:`cds-holder-java-spring`
    b) Conformance reporting for PRD: :ref:`cds-conformance`
    c) Client CLI with integrated Discovery & Conformance: :ref:`cds-client-java-cli`
    
  3) Discovery Client and Server demonstration: :ref:`cds-registry`  
  4) Demonstration of the Desktop Sandbox: :ref:`cds-desktop-sandbox`
  5) Prepare and Execute Engineering Workshop #2 scheduled for 13 June 2019
  6) Provide report generation of PRD's for Human Review


**Feedback Open**

While the Standards have been released at **0.9.3**, engineering work continues in order to align. Multiple participants have kindly submitted informal feedback and we now have a GitHub issue for collating this further in `Engineering Issue #41 <https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/engineering/issues/41>`__.

While we will open a more formal feedback request after releasing **0.9** of the Engineering Artefacts we thank those who have already provided feedback and encourage further feedback as the artefacts are tested by individual teams.

**Engineering Workshop #2**

As outlined in the `May 2019 Working Draft <https://consumerdatastandards.org.au/standards/may-2019-working-draft/>`__ announcement there will a number of individual Stream based workshops. 

The Engineering workshop shall be held **13 June 2019** in *Sydney*. 

Unfortunately due to resourcing constraints this will be the only workshop for Engineering in June. Based on feedback we will evaluate whether additional workshops are necessary in the following months.

We encourage all parties to attend as we intend to provide a detailed run-through of each artefact along with context on where these artefacts are useful.
