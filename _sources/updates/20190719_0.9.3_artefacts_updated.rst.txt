Hi there,

Recently I have updated some 0.9.3 artefacts.

The updates are:

1. Added unit tests for regular expressions of CDS data types such as Rate, Amount, Duration etc and fixed some bugs
2. Added cds-reflection as a separate repo to be used by cds-codegen and cds-conformance
3. Refactored APIModel and its related parts out of cds-codegen and put into cds-models so that cds-conformance does not need to depend on cds-codegen anymore

To get the latest conformance docker image, please run

``docker pull consumerdatastandardsaustralia/cds-conformance:0.9.3-SNAPSHOT``

and then follow :ref:`cds-conformance`

Any feedback is welcome, just open an issue on GitHub.

Thanks,

Fei
