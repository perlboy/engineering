Engineering Workshops
=======================================================

| Each organisation participating in the Consumer Data Right have different perspectives on how they are developing their technology infrastructure. These can be loosely defined as being a Data Provider, a Data Recipient or Both. In an effort to ensure balanced participation the workshops are intended to individually focus with these two lenses in mind so that suggestions, contributions and discussion can be considered in context to deliver a useful result.

| Consequently, where each individual deems relevant, we encourage participants consider participation in both sets of workshops.

Purpose of the Workshops
----------------------------

| The purpose of the Data Holder workshops is to identify, discuss and consult on how Data61 as the interim standards body can promote efficient implementation within a Holders environment. This will not only consider the server side deliverables but also conformance and security systems implementations. It may also consider how a Data Holder can promote innovation within a Sandbox delivery context.

| The purpose of the Data Recipient workshops is to identify, discuss and consult on how Data61 as the interim standards body can provide the lowest friction technical pathway for potential Data Recipients to utilise the emerging standard. It will also consider the pathways that Data61 intends to deliver and promote with relation to the delivery of Sandbox capability.
