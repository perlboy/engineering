Sandbox Artefacts
================================================

In order to demonstrate all of the components working together :term:`CDS Engineering` is working on providing a set of orchestration scripts to easily get started working with the :term:`Consumer Data Standards`.

Currently, we are focused on a Desktop Sandbox with the intention that a Developer can establish a full simulation on their Development workstation.

:term:`CDS Engineering` intends to evaluate whether this initial orchestration should be expanded to facilitate a Cloud-based Internet Accessible Sandbox environment.
