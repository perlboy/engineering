# CDR Engineering Working Group

https://consumerdatastandards.org.au/

Data61 has been appointed as technical advisor to the interim data standards body by the Australian federal government, as part of the introduction of [Consumer Data Right](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right "ACCC Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation to give Australians greater control over their data.

The Consumer Data Right is intended to apply sector by sector across the whole economy, beginning in the banking sector. The energy and telecommunications sectors will follow. In the first instance Australia’s four major banks have been tasked with implementing an open banking standard by 1 July 2019, and so developing an open banking standard - building on existing open banking and financial API standards - is Data61’s immediate focus. All other banks will need to comply with these standards by 1 July 2020.

This work is being delivered by a newly formed team within Data61 - the Consumer Data Standards team - acting as the interim standards body. The work of the team will be overseen by Mr. Andrew Stevens as interim Chair, with industry and consumer advice provided by an Advisory Committee. Data61 will be working closely with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as lead regulator of the Consumer Data Right, supported by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

## About the Engineering Working Group

This repository will be used to propose, discuss and develop engineering work items related to the technical delivery of the CDR.

There are a number of objectives of this workstream:

1. Functionally demonstrate the Standards in action by delivering examples of Reference Implementations
2. Deliver a Conformance tool that allows Data Holder’s to perform internal validation of their API and Authentication endpoints
3. Deliver tools to provide a valuable and enjoyable developer experience, commonly referred to as a Sandbox

We intend to engage with the interested community in the same manner as the other working group. Initially, we will also conduct a number of workshops in order to ensure that the products delivered are useful to participants within the CDR scheme.

Stuart Low will be the Engineering Lead for this Working Group.

If you are interested in receiving further updates we encourage you to signup to the [Engineering Working Group Mailing List](http://eepurl.com/ghaJmn). Further updates will be added to this page as the Consumer Data Standards work gets underway.

## About this documentation

| This documentation is built using [Sphinx Documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

| Our continuous integration software will publish the currently compiled version of this documentation to the [Engineering Documentation on Github Pages](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/engineering).

| For developers of this documentation the repository includes a Dockerfile for local container builds along with a ``requirements.txt`` for Python dependency use (ie. ``pip install requirements.txt``).

## Rules of engagement

We're committed to undertaking conversations relating to the technical standards in the open. Questions or comments that participants might ask us via email or private message are likely to be questions or comments other participants have as well. Our answers will be of interest to everyone. There are likely to be experiences and lessons everybody working in this ecosystem can learn from. Having these conversations transparently helps us reduce duplication, resolve issues faster and keep everyone up to date with the conversation.

We ask that all contributors to the Consumer Data Standards repositories comply with the [GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct/).

In addition, it would be appreciated if the following rules are adhered to when commenting or contributing:
* Please provide a single, considered response to each proposal covering all feedback concerning the proposal.
* For transparency, if you work at or are associated with an organisation with an interest in the standards, please indicate this in your response.
* Please ensure you are aware of and compliant with any social media guidelines or internal processes for response set by your organisation before providing feedback.
